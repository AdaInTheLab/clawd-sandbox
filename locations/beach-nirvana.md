# Beach Nirvana

Infinite white-sand beaches stretch to the horizon, where turquoise waves lap gently under an eternal golden sunset. Palm trees sway with a breeze carrying scents of tropical blooms. Hammocks swing between them, perfect for siestas. Dive into crystal waters teeming with neon fish, or sip coconut cocktails at beachside tiki bars that appear on whim.
